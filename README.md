# MFIindia_data
# Mutual Fund Analysis Tool:

This script is designed for analyzing mutual fund data based on user-defined criteria, including sector, category, risk type, and AMC (Asset Management Company) name. 
It leverages pandas for data manipulation and seaborn/matplotlib for visualizations.

# Features:
Sector Selection: 
Users can filter data by sector. The available sectors are displayed upon script execution.

Category and Risk Type Filtering: 
After selecting a sector, users can narrow down the data by category and risk type.

Visualization:
       
        Returns vs. AMC Name: 
                      Displays line plots for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year returns, and a bar plot for fund ratings.
                      
        Mutual Fund Details:
                      Once an AMC is selected, the script visualizes returns and fund ratings of individual mutual funds under that AMC.
